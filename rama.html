                Dasaratha, a descendant of Ishvaku dynasty ruled over Kosala. 
                He ruled the country well without giving room for any criticism. 
                The country was very prosperous. Everyone was happy. Dasaratha has three wives, 
                Kausalya, Sumitra and Kaikeyi but none had any issues. Dasaratha wanted a son and
                 heir to the throne. On the advice of his family preceptor Vasishta the King performed
                  a special sacrifice and with the result four sons were born to him.

          <h4><p>
            As Rama attained the marriageable age the king had consultations with Vasishta about the marriage of
             his son. Just then sage Viswamitra was announced and the king welcomed him with due formalities. At
              the request of the king, Viswamitra said "O! King Dasaratha! My sacrificial activities are disturbed
               regularly and wantonly by the Rakshasas and I have come here to take Rama to be of help to me." The
                King though unwilling at first, accepted
                 to send Rama and his brother Lakshmana with the sage on the advice of his Kulaguru (family preceptor).

            On the way to the forest Viswamitra taught Rama several mantras (incantations) and astras 
            (missiles).


            On reaching his hermitage the sage instructed the princes as to their work and said that
             any rakshasa whether a male or female must be put an end to when they appear to disturb
              and spoil the sacrifice. Rama killed first Thataka, a Rakshasi, then Subhahu. The third
               was Maaricha whom Rama did not kill but dropped him in the far of sea near Lanka through 
               an Astra. Viswamitra successfully completed his sacrificial work.

            Mithila was the capital of Videha kingdom ruled by the Janaka. Janaka had a daughter Sita by
             name. There was a great Bow with Janaka who had proclaimed that whoever was capable of lifting and 
             stringing the bow would be the husband of Sita. Viswamitra knew this. But without telling anything 
             the sage took the brothers to Mithila. Rama saw it and with the permission of his Guru and King
              Janaka took it with ease. 
              Rama and Sita were married. On the same day the other brothers too were married to different
               princesses connected with Janaka's royal family.

            Dasaratha after consulting his preceptors and the elders called for a general council and with the
             common consent of the Yuvaraj. This was acclaimed
             by all wholeheartedly. He ordered that the preprations for Cornation of Rama might be begun at once.
             As the arrangements were going to Manthara a confidential maid of Kaikeyi went to her queen and said,
              "O! Queen! Why are you relaxing here so calmly when a big misfortune is going to overtake you?" 
              After a prolonged discussion the queen fell a prey to that evil minded servant maid.

             difficulty and
             it was decided that Rama should be exiled for fourteen years and Bharatha to be installed as Yuvaraj.
             Rama said without the least change in his face "Mother, I will go to forest immediately
             In the meanwhile, King Dasaratha, not able to bear the separation of his darling son Rama, died.

            On other hand,Rama now planned to leave Chitrakoota and visit various ashrams. 
            On the way he visited many sages. The great sage Agastya was one of them. 
            Agastya suggested that Panchavati would be an ideal place for Rama's further stay. So Rama did.
            Panchavati may be taken as the starting point for certain developments.
             This area was occupied by Surpanaka the sister of Ravana of Lanka.She wanted to marry Rama. 
             Then Lakshmana mutilated her by cutting off her nose and ear.

            Ravana without a second thought went straight to Maaricha and

            Sita saw the dear and wanted Rama to get it for her to play.
            As fate would have it, Rama went behind the deer, of course placing Lakshmana to guard Sita in his absence. 
            . Sita was adamant and uttered certain very cruel and poignant words against Lakshmana.
             Lakshmana could not bear the force of her words and went to save his brother leaving her alone.

              Soon,A Sanyasi should be respected and so Sita respectfully gave him a seat in the hut. After a few
               minutes she understood it was Ravana and inspite of her protests the cruel Rakshasa picked her up
                and away went his aerial car (Vimana) with her.


              On the way Jatayu the great eagle king saw it and wanted to arrest Ravana's Vimana, but
               Ravana cut the bird's wing and proceeded.

            The brothers now knew that Sita was abducted by Ravana. 
            They went on and on and at last came to Rishyamukha mountain, directed by Kabanda,
             a headless rakshasa to meet Sugreeva who alone would be able to help Rama in finding out Sita. 
             Here Hanuman met the Ikshawaku brothers. Hanuman having heard their story said in turn that his
              King Sugreeva too was in the same predicament, 
             having lost his wife and having been turned out of the kingdom by his brother the valiant Vaali.

            Then according to the mutual understanding arrived at by Sugreeva and Rama, the latter 
            promised to help Sugreeva and make him the King of Kishkinda and also retrieve his wife. In
             return Sugreeva prompted to help Rama to find out Sita and help him in every effort.
            Vaali was killed as promised by Rama. Sugreeva was made the King of Kishkinda.

            that sita devi from Jambavan was in lanka under the control of ravana. 
            Now the great problem how to cross the vast sheet of water and reach Lanka arose. It was
             not a short distance. It was nearly 800 miles of water. No one was found fit for this hazardous work. 
             Jambavan said, "Aanjaneya you are the son of Vaayu, the Wind God. 
             You alone have the capacity to fly across this vast ocean. You do not know your prowess.
             This was a sort of fillip to Hanuman. He became brisk, took permission from his leader Aangada.

            contracted himself to an ordinary monkey. Just at midnight he slowly moved into the city. 
            No where he could find Sita.
            . Suddenly he saw in the faint moonlight some lady sitting under a Simsupa
             tree in the middle of the grove.
             Just then Hanuman jumped down and whispered he was the servant of Rama. He gave 
             her the Signet-Ring of Ram in proof of the same which Rama had given when he started for the search. 
             Aanjaneya took leave of Sita aand began destroying the fine parks and gardens. 
             Ravana wanted to kill Aanjaneya,so Ravana ordered that the monkey's tail be
              set fire to. It was done and Aanjaneya used that splendid opportunity to burn most part of Sri Lanka.

             not lose heart and they decided to build a bridge across the sea and really a bridge was build in just
