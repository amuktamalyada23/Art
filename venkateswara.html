         <h4><p>In the  ancient  period all the saints assembled together to conduct a sacrifice for 
             the goodness
             of the world.There came the famous Saints Narada.He asked them whom did they want to give the 
                sacrificial result,whether it was to brahma or  Vishnu or Maheswara .They replied  
                that they wanted 
               to give it to the GOD who could control the Sathva,Rejas,Thamo Qualities.Then started 
               the argument
                 who was the greatest among the Trois.At last Saint Bhrugu was directed to find out 
                 who was the greatest</p></h4>

                 <h4><p>Saint Bhrughu who knew about the past, present and future acquired a third eye in his
                      inner foot through his powerful penance.The great Bhrughu First went to the world of
                       Lord Brahma.Brahma was chit-chattering with his wife Goddess Saraswathy.He did not
                        pay proper attention to Bhrughu.The angry Bhrugu said that through Brahma had four
                         faces and eight eyes He could not see the guest coming.So Brahma did not deserve 
                         the sacrificial result. Since Brahma was indulged in Rejas Bhrughu  cursed him that
                          Brahma  would never get offerings  in the temples.That is why Brahma had no temple.
 
                    Saint Bhrugu`s mind was hurt .He started from the world of Brahma and reached Kailasa
                     mountain , the abode of Lord Siva.There Bhrugu  saw Lord Siva and his wife Goddess 
                      Parvathy engaged in a happy dance.Nandhi the chief disciple and many others were
                       standing  absorbed in the dance. Siva could not receive his guest properly,Brughu
                        became angry and said that shiva did not deserve the sacrificial result. He 
                        cursed Shiva that he never get an idol worship in the temples. Instead the 
                        system of worshiping  Siva in the form of Phallus came into existence

                        Bhrugu reached  Vaikunda, the residence of Lord MahaVishnu.Bhrughu saw Vishnu lying with 
                        his wife Goddess Lakshmi upon the snake Anandha. Which is his bed. Narayana saw Bhrughu coming
                        . He pretended that he did not see him and engaged in chit chattering with Lakshmi Devi.Without
                         thinking who he was and what he was doing Bhrughu put his foot on Narayana`s Breast.Narayana 
                         got up calmly and tell at the feet of Bhrughu for pardon. He repented that he had done wrong 
                         by not carrying Bhrughu.He asked Bhrughu when he put his foot on Narayanas breast whether his
                          foot was hurt by the jewels worn by Narayana in his breast. To remove the pain he rubbed the
                           feet of burughu.While doing this he destroyed the third eye in the inner foot.Having lost 
                           the third eye Bhrughu lost all his arrogance.He understood his guilt and praised Vishnu.He
                            returned to the saints and told them that Sri Hari was the greatest among the Trios. He 
                            asked them to give the sacrificial result to Mahavishnu Lakshmi Devi`s abode is at Vishnu`s
                             breast. When Bhrughu put  his foot on Vishnu`s Breast he fell at the feet of Bhrughu and 
                             begged forgiveness.He did not show any anger against Bhrughu.when Lakshmi Devi saw this she
                              became very angry towards
                         husband without knowing the truth Vishnu tried to calm Lakshmi Devi.But……..

MahaVishnu convinced his state to Varaha Moorthy .He got permission and place to stay there. Then he started
 penance sitting in a termitary
Mahavishnu came to the earth  and started penance .During His Penance he was tormented by lack of sleep and
 food. Saint Narada told that to Parvathy Devi.Because of her prayer  Brahma and Siva changed

the wound.The cattle shepherd fell unconscious. The King ran to Vishnu and tell at his feet and begged for
 mercy. Vishnu Cursed  him to become a Devil. He said that in the next birth the King of Chola would born 
 as king of Sky .When Vishnu marries his daughter Padmavathy  the king would get salvation.since the cattle

 see Vishnu after coming to earth  his race would get the privilege to see him first in Vishu`s temple.
