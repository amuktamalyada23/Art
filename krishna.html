                <p>
                    In DwaparaYuga, the demon-like king Kamsa ruled the kingdom of Mathura (that
                     belonged to the Yadava clan) by overthrowing his father and the king Ugrasena.
                      He became too powerful and people on earth as well as Devas (the celestial beings)
                       suffered immeasurably under his tyrannical rule. Moved by the earnest prayers of
                        the sufferers, Lord Vishnu decided to take birth in human form and annihilate the
                         evil forces headed by Kamsa.
                        </p>

            <h4><p>
                The King Kamsa was forewarned by his astrologers that his death would be caused by the eighth son who would
 be born to his cousin Devaki. To prevent such a happening, Kamsa arrested Devaki and her husband Vasudeva
  and incarcerated them in his prison.
As and when a child was born to the couple, he would go to the jail and kill the child then and there. 
When the eighth child was born, it was Lord Krishna.
                By a dramatic divine play, at the midnight when the birth took place, the child was miraculously
                 and secretively transported to Gokula (a community of cow herds belonging to Yadava clan at the 
                 banks of river Yamuna) to become the foster son of mother Yasoda and King Nanda. A female child
                  born to them (Maya) at the same time was transported back to the prisons. It was Vasudev, Krishna’s
                   father, who did the exchange of th
                 babies at the behest of a divine command. 
                  these took place without the knowledge of Devaki and Yasoda.

                   kill the boy-who-escaped from the prison. Little Krishna encountered all of them (Putana, Sakatasura,
                   Bakasura, Trinavarta, Vatsasura, Aghasura etc) and killed them all as a matter of child play.

                    the entire community by lifting up the hill Govardhan by holding it like an umbrella at his little finger.

                      at Mathura and finally killed
                     his uncle in a ferocious combat. He released his parents from the jail and re-throned Ugrasena as the king.

                        In this great spiritual discourse, Lord Krishna predominantly teaches Karma Yoga – the path of attaining
                         the greatest
                         goal of life though self-less action by surrendering all the fruits of actions at the feet of lord.
