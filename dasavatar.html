            <h4><p>The Dashavathara refers to the ten Primary incarnations of Lord Vishnu, the god
                 of preservation. Vishnu is said to descend in the form of an avatar to restore 
                 balance in the world.
                The list of included avatars varies across sects and regions. All avatars have 
                appeared except Kalki, who will appear at the end of the Kali Yuga.
                It describes the cycle of human evolution beginning in water as Matsya the fish, 
                on to the amphibious phase as Koorma, the tortoise, on to 
                begin firmly established on land as the wild boar Varaha, then Narsimha- half man- half animal,
                 followed by Vamana, the Dwarf man, on to Parashurama, the emotionally volatile man, on to Rama,
                  the peaceful man, then Krishna, a loving man followed by Buddha, the meditative man, 
                  who is said to be succeeded by the final incarnation of Vishnu, or the last stage 
                  of evolution as Kalki, the mystical man.

                <h4><p>
                    Matsya, (“Fish”) one of the 10 avatars (incarnations) of the Hindu god Vishnu. In this
                     appearance Vishnu saved the world from a great flood. Manu, the first man, caught a little
                      fish that grew to giant size. When the flood approached, Manu saved himself by tying his 
                      boat to the horn on the fish’s head. Some early accounts refer to the fish-saviour 
                    as Prajapati (whose identity is later merged with that of Brahma). Later sources identified him as Vishnu.

                <h4><p>
                    Kurma, (“Tortoise”) one of the 10 avatars (incarnations) of the Hindu god Vishnu. In this incarnation
                     Vishnu is associated with the myth of the churning of the ocean of milk. The gods and the asuras 
                     (demons) cooperated in the churning to obtain amrita, the elixir of immortality. The great serpent 
                     Vasuki offered himself as a rope, and Mount Mandara was torn out for use as a churning stick. Afirm
                      foundation was required to steady the mountain, so Vishnu took the form of a tortoise and supported 
                      the churning stick on his back. An earlier reference to a divine incarnation as a tortoise 
                    identifies the animal with Prajapati (the god Brahma), who took that shape in order to create offspring.

                <h4><p>
                    Varaha, (“Boar”) third of the 10 incarnations (avatars) of the Hindu god Vishnu. When a demon named
                     Hiranyaksha dragged the earth to the bottom of the sea, Vishnu took the form of a boar in order to
                      rescue it. They fought for a thousand years. Then Varaha slew the demon and raised the earth out
                       of the water with his tusks. The myth reflects an earlier creation legend of Prajapati 
                    (Brahma), who assumed the shape of a boar in order to lift the earth up out of the primeval waters.

                <h4><p>
                    Lord Vishnu takes the form of Narasimha in his fourth incarnation, to kill
                     Hiranyakashipu the brother of Hiranyaksha .
 Hiranyakashipu performs penance to please Brahma, the god of creation. He asks for a tricky boon.
  That he would not die either on earth or in space; nor in fire nor in water; neither during day nor at
   night; neither inside nor outside nor by a human, animal or God; neither by inanimate nor
    by animate being.
Brahma grants the boon. So hiranyakashipu declares himself as god and asks people to utter no god’s name
 except his. However his son Prahlada  refuses. Repeated pressurization on him yields no results for 
 Hiranyakashipu. Prahlada declares the omnipresence of Lord Vishnu.
Once Hiranyakashipu points to a pillar and asks if Vishnu is present in it. Prahlada nods in affirmative.
 Angered at it, he draws his sword and cuts the pillar; Narasimha appears out of the broken pillar. 
 Narasimha kills Hiranyakashipu.

                <h3><strong>Vamana Avatar</strong></h3>
                <h4><p>Vamana, fifth of the 10 incarnations (avatars) of the Hindu god Vishnu.
                    In the Rigveda, Vishnu took three strides, with which he measured out the three
                     worlds: earth, heaven, and the space between them. In later mythology, the dwarf
                      Vamana made his appearance when the demon king Bali ruled the entire universe and
                       the gods had lost their power. One day Vamana visited the court of Bali and begged
                        of him as much land as he could step over in three paces. The king laughingly
                         granted the request. Assuming a gigantic form, Vamana with one step covered
                          the whole earth, and with the second step the midworld between earth and heaven.
                           As there was nowhere left to go, the demon king lowered his head and suggested
                           
                            Vamana place his foot on it for the promised third step. Vamana was pleased,
                             and with the pressure of his foot sent Bali down below to rule the netherworld.
                         Vishnu in this form is often identified as Trivikrama (“God of the Three Strides”).

                        Parashurama, (Sanskrit: “Rama with the Ax”) one of the 10 avatars (incarnations) of the Hindu
                         god Vishnu. In the Ramayana he encounters another avatar, Rama, who wins the bow of the god Shiva,
                          which Parashurama had given to Rama’s father-in-law. Rama later subdues Parashurama when challenged
                           to a fight. Parashurama is the traditional founder of Malabar and is said to have bestowed land
                            there on members of the priestly class whom he brought down from the north in order 
                        to expiate his slaughter of the Kshatriyas. Temples dedicated to Parashurama are found throughout India

                         there are three Ramas mentioned in Indian tradition—Parashurama, Balarama, and Ramachandra—the name is
                          specifically associated with Ramachandra, the seventh incarnation (avatar) of Vishnu. His story is
                           told briefly in the 
                        Mahabharata (“Great Epic of the Bharata Dynasty”) and at great length in the Ramayana (“Rama’s Journey”).

                          among those members of Vaishnava sects who elevate Krishna to the rank of a principal god. Other 
                          legends identify him as the human incarnation of the serpent Shesha. He may originally have been
                           an agricultural deity, for as early as the 
                        2nd–1st century BCE he was depicted holding a plowshare and a pestle, with a snake canopy above his head.

                              ruled by the unjust, Kalkin will appear to destroy the wicked and to usher in a new age. He will be
                               seated on a white horse with a naked sword in his hand, blazing like a comet. He is less commonly
                                represented in painting and sculpture than the other avatars of Vishnu and is shown either on
                                 horseback or accompanied by his horse. According to some legends of the end of the world, Kalkin’s
                                  horse will stamp the earth with its right foot, causing the tortoise which supports
                             the world to drop into the deep. Then the gods will restore the earth once again to its former purity.
