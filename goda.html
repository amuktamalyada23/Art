                On that day, like any other day, Perialwar
                 was collecting flowers in a basket. His forehead was adorned with bright “ThirumaN and Srichurnam" .

                He was singing hymns on Sri Krishna, when he heard a baby cry. The cry of the baby puzzled him. He
                 went around the garden in search of the crying sound. To his surprise, he saw a baby under
                  a Tulasi bush. 
                  With all his eyes on the baby, Perialwar put his basket down and slowly bent towards the baby.
                   It was a pretty baby girl

                  Perialwar did 
                 not have any kids of his own. He named the baby “Godhai” (beautiful garland) and took her 
                 home.

                Perialwar showered all his love and affection on Godhai.  He would always tell Godhai about Krishna
                 and HIS leelas. When When Due to her influence even her pet parrot would always Krishna’s
                  various names.
                  As Godhai grew into a young girl, her Krishna Bhakti transformed into love towards Krishna. Like her father, even Godhai started writing hymns on Krishna.
                   She would also accompany her father to the garden to gather flowers for "Vadapathrasayee."
                   One night Godhai dreamt that she was marrying Lord Krishna. The dream made her very happy.

 She thought if she were
 to be the bride for Krishna, she should look beautiful with the garland. She took the garland in her hand
  and adorned herself. She wanted to check her beauty.

            <h4><p>
                Unaware of all these, Perialwar took the garland and offered it to “Vadapathrasayee”. He felt Perumal
                 looked more beautiful than ever before. Right from the next day, Godhai started adorning herself with
                  Vadapathrasayee’s garland. She would then check her beauty in the well and she would place the
                 garland back in its original place. This was happening for quite few days without Perialwar’s knowledge.

            <h4><p>
                One fine day Perialwar saw Godhai wearing the garland. He was stunned and shocked. He felt ashamed that
                 he had been offering the garland worn by Godhai to Vadapathrasayee. He scolded Godhai for wearing 
                 Perumal’s Garland.
                  He hurried to his garden, collected
                 flowers again and made a new garland and offered it to Perumal. Perialwar was restless the whole day.

            <h4><p>
                The same day night “Vadapathrasayee” appeared in his dream. HE said that HE liked only the garland worn
                 by Godhai and that everyday HE wanted Godhai to wear the garland before HE wore it . With that Perialwar
                  woke up. He called Godhai and told all about his dream. Godhai was very happy that “Vadapathrasyee”
                   wanted her to wear the garland first. Right from that day, Godhai would wear the garland before it
                    had been offered to Vadapathrasayee. 
                Since Godhai ruled Vadapathrasayee with her affection, Perialwar started calling her “Andal”- 
                one who rules.

            <h4><p>
                Andal learnt from an elderly person, that, during Krishna Avatar all Gopikas performed a 
                fast in the
                  month of Margazhi in order to marry Krishna. 
                   One night Lord Ranganatha of Srirangam appeared in Perialwar’s dream and asked him to bring
                    Andal to Srirangm fully dressed as a bride. Sri Ranganatha also appeared in
                    the King’s dream and asked him to make arrangements for Andal Kalyanam.

                 After some years, Perialwar transformed his house into a temple for Andal and Sri
                  Ranganatha. But Sri Ranganathar is called Ranga Mannar in this temple. This temple 
                  along with Vadapathrasayee temple will always remind everyone of Andal and her true 
                  
                  love towards Sri Krishna.
